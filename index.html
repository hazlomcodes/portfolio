    <h3>About me</h3>
    <section>
    <p> My name is Harry Lomas. I am 24 years old and located in Manchester. I gradauated from the University of Leeds in 2019 with a degree in the arts however upon graduating i realised my real passion lied in tech. </p>
    <p> I got into coding while furloughed over the pandemic before returning to restaurant work. I love the freedom and possibilites of code as it allows me to express myself in a multitude of ways. I wish to transition into a career in tech to give myself a healthier work life balance, and spend more time with the people I love.</p>
