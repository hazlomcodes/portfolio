        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I graduatd from The University of Leeds in 2019 with an arts degree. However upon my graduation i found that my chosen field of work was unsatisfying. Whilst furloughed during the pandemic I began coding some very base HTML and CSS and found it very rewarding and enjoyable. As such i enrolled onto the September 2022 cohort of Manchester Codes to further my curiosity. Whilst partaking in the course I quickly realised I would love to have a career in tech. Tech is a constantly evolving innovative and rewarding sector and one as such i wish to transition to a career in this field. I believe this career choice will provide me with a greater work-life balance more freedom and ensure I am able to build better personal and professional relationships.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Student Repo- This project familiarised me with numerous aspects of Github such as Git add, Git commit (always with a meaningful message :)) and Git push. This exercise also showed the importance of Git status and branching. </li>
        
        <li> The CLI Murder Mystery- This project helped familiarise me with the command line interface through a file based detective game wherin one must naviagte the CLI to find the murderer.</li>
        
        <li> This portfolio page :) - This exercise has furthered my understanding of CSS and HTML and allowed me to express creative freedom over a web page.</li>
    </ul>
